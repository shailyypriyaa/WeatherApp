This project is something about which I heard a lot and hence I wanted to try it out.     
While creating this weather app, I got to know that how we can fetch data from APIs and how we can display it in our website.     
In this project, one can enter their desired city name and they'll get to know about the temperature, wind speed and humidity of that particular city.
