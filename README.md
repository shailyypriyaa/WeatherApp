This project is something about which I heard a lot and hence I wanted to try it out.         
WeatherApp is a lightweight web application that offers real-time weather information for cities worldwide. With an intuitive interface, users can easily check current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.             

While creating this weather app, I got to know that how we can fetch data from APIs and how we can display it in our website.     
In this project, one can enter their desired city name and they'll get to know about the temperature, wind speed and humidity of that particular city.
